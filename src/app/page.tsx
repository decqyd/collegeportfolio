                            at the moment, my main hobbies consist of playing the guitar and programming.
                            i've been playing both accoustic and electric guitar since year 3, which also where i started 
                            practicing for and taking guitar grades at various levels. the latest grade i've taken is grade 8, 
                            the most difficult and last grade that you can take; i passed with a merit.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            i started programming near the start of primary school, where we learned the basics of both scratch and python.
                            i didn't touch programming again until around august of 2019, where i rediscovered python and,
                            with the help of a few youtube videos, improved my ability to read and write code, as well as expand my skillset to other languages.
                            <br/>
                            i also occasionally go to the gym. üèãÔ∏è
